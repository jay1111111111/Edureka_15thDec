Intructions to use the sourced files:

Pls import all the data to your system and then do the changes in:
Browser driver path which is used in each class files
add the relivent jars
move the additional projects from the folder to outside of the folder.

Maven project:
Copy the project outside this project folder and then import it to Eclipse
